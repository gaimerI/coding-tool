# Markdown Formatting Example

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Below are some examples of how to use Markdown.

You can create headers by using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the header.

- `# Header 1`
- `## Header 2`
- `### Header 3`

### Emphasis

You can emphasize text using asterisks or underscores:

- *Italic* text can be created with one asterisk or underscore: `*italic*` or `_italic_`
- **Bold** text can be created with two asterisks or underscores: `**bold**` or `__bold__`
- ***Bold and italic*** can be created with three asterisks: `***bold and italic***`

### Lists

You can create ordered and unordered lists:

- Unordered list:
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
    - Subitem 2.1
    - Subitem 2.2

1. Ordered list:
   1. First item
   2. Second item
      1. Subitem 2.1
      2. Subitem 2.2
